# Handoff: full test & fix campaign (state on 2026-11-03)

Notes for whoever continues the work. The owner speaks Turkish: answer in Turkish; code, comments
and commits in English. Delete this file once the work is finished.

## The owner's request

- Test the application from top to bottom: every feature, every button, every menu, with real data.
- It must work with **any** data, not only the owner's (MaxIm DL files from the TUG T100 telescope):
  phone pictures (JPEG/PNG/TIFF), DSLR raw, cubes, compressed FITS, odd headers, other observatories.
- Problems that only show up on one distribution (Arch / CachyOS) must be fixed too. The owner also tests on Windows.
- Push straight to `main`. A new release only after CI is fully green, and only after asking the owner.

## Rules of the repository

- The product name may appear only in `brand.toml`, `README.md` and `packaging/install.sh`
  (`tools/check_brand.py`). Everywhere else, this file included, write "the application".
- Before every push: `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen sh tools/precommit.sh`
  (ruff check, ruff format --check, brand check, i18n check, pytest; about 7 minutes, ~520 tests).
- Every user-visible string goes through i18n: `python tools/i18n.py update`, fill the tr/de/es
  translations, then `python tools/i18n.py` to compile. Messages raised in engine steps need a template in
  `src/astrowb/ui/messages.py` and a case in `tests/test_messages.py`.
- The user guide is in `resources/guide/{en,tr,de,es}`; all four must have the same `##` sections.
- Engine steps (`@step`) run in worker processes started with *spawn*: any script that drives the
  application needs an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard.
- Never commit the owner's data files.

## Done (all pushed to main)

- Packaged application: SSL certificates via certifi (Arch failed on HTTPS); PyInstaller hooks for
  astroquery, pyvo and photutils data and metadata; `selfcheck.py` checks modules, data files and
  libraries during the CI smoke test; `--check-online` and Help → "Check the installation and internet
  services" test every online service (SIMBAD, VizieR, VSX, Exoplanet Archive, SkyBoT, hips2fits, ZTF, AAVSO,
  MAST, spectral libraries, IERS) and show the report in a window.
- Uncaught errors in the interface show a dialog and go to `error.log`; the window opens sized to the screen.
- Real-observatory FITS headers: non-standard cards (written with `silentfix`), values with units
  (`hdr.py`: `number()` / `get()`, used everywhere headers are read), SITELONG written in hours
  (`timing._longitude` checks it against the sidereal time), 16-bit files with BZERO, cubes (first plane).
- Any picture opens everywhere: JPEG/PNG/TIFF/BMP/WebP and DSLR raw get a FITS copy (`io/bayer.py`:
  `fits_copy`, `fits_paths`); pictures next to FITS frames are treated as previews, not frames.
  Drag and drop onto the window works.
- Calibrate page: explanation of which folder to choose, several folders (`;`), message when there are
  no lights, a master group that fails (e.g. flats darker than the bias) is reported and skipped instead of
  stopping the whole calibration.
- Star-pattern alignment works on real frames (star detection margins and saturation).
- Photometry page: cross cursor, aperture rings follow the mouse, clicking a star again removes it,
  ring colour shows the next role, Graph tab selector filled.
- Moving objects: unsolved frames are plate-solved automatically (scale hint) or skipped.
  astrometry.net called with flags that avoid its Python helpers.
- Period search on a too-short light curve gives a clear message.
- Plan page: list of observatories (astropy sites + `resources/observatories.json`) with completion;
  exposure-time calculator dialog.
- Saving publication figures / pictures falls back to PNG for unknown extensions; model curves read
  files in any encoding.
- Installer (`packaging/install.sh`): menu icon fixed.
- The three example plugins are documented in the Plugins menu.
- Intel Mac: `cryptography<49` there (from 49 PyPI has no Intel-Mac wheel; the source build linked
  Homebrew OpenSSL and the bundle failed with "Symbol not found: _SSL_get0_group_name").
- On the owner's real TUG night every engine step runs; the end-of-night, eclipsing-binary and transit
  automations run through.

## Second campaign (real mouse events on real-like data, all pushed to main)

Driving scripts with QTest clicks on generated data that imitates MaxIm DL nights, phone pictures, long-slit
spectra, eclipsing binaries, a delta Scuti star, O-C minima, a visual binary and a 5-band UTM GeoTIFF, plus the
INDI simulators (`apt install indi-bin`). Fixed on the way, each with a test:

- Marked stars visible on a zoomed-out frame (fixed-size rings); gzipped FITS thumbnails 44 s -> instant;
  8-bit pictures (phone, JPEG, colour PNG) readable on every astropy version (quantised data found from the data).
- Plan page look-ups failed on a background thread (Qt crash risk): `run_step(..., on_fail=...)` runs on the GUI
  thread; error texts drop module paths.
- Observation times: date + UTSTART / UT-START / TIME_OBS / UTC, old dd/mm/yy, MJD, EXP_TIME / ITIME; a date
  without a time of day is an error instead of midnight.
- Spectroscopy: a line window that cuts the line is pointed out; reduced spectra not listed twice.
- Light curves: "Remove outliers" judged points against the median and deleted the eclipses; now against the
  neighbours in time (per night) and, with a period, in phase (cf. lightkurve: flatten, then clip).
- Downloads name their archive and show their error; O-C asks for T0 and P; MCMC shows T0 with decimals; model
  and automation failures are shown on their pages; the area tool's 3-D surface exports as CSV.
- 98 engine error messages had no template (shown in English in every language): translated, and
  `test_every_engine_error_has_a_template` keeps it so.
- A target or comparison star outside the frame is named (photutils gave an array message).
- Observe page: a finished slew shows 100 % and "Finished.".
- Camera clock: one setting (Calibrate page, saved) now applies to pictures and raw files opened on every page;
  default = the computer's UTC offset (as Siril via libraw); the Photometry page shows the offset used.

Checked and correct, nothing to fix: Images page tools and all 16 Process operations, levels, blink, overlays,
save/convert; period search (BLS/PDM exact, LS/ANOVA give P/2 on an Algol, as expected); frequency analysis
(12.3454 / 15.0994 c/d vs 12.3456 / 15.1); O-C linear/quadratic/LTTE/apsidal; EB fit (i 86.46 vs 86.5);
transit export; visual orbit (P 31.38 vs 31.4 yr); remote sensing (pixel read-out, UTM -> lon/lat, NDVI,
k-means, PCA); eclipsing-binary automation (minimum 15.7 s from an independent astropy BJD, 2 sigma); Observe
page with INDI simulators (slew, preview, cooler, focuser, filter, sequence, abort, resume, park).

## Still to do

1. **CI**: confirm the latest run is green on every job (the macOS 8-bit test failure is fixed in `ccc34e3`).
2. Not reachable from the build container: SIMBAD, VizieR, VSX, AAVSO, ZTF, hips2fits (CDS / IRSA blocked) and
   MAST through the container's CA bundle. The owner checks them with Help -> "Check the installation and
   internet services".
3. **Spectroscopy and photometry with the owner's real data**: ask for spectra and a night.
4. Known limit: the third-body O-C fit has a linear ephemeris only (no simultaneous period change term).
5. When everything is green and tested: ask the owner about a new release (tag `v*` starts the release job).
